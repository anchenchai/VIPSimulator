1) To simulate the execution of workflows, we need :

   a. the platform description: we have 2 platform descriptions generated from real execution traces in this folder ("3level_scale" and "Avg_Merged_factor").

   b. the workflow deployment file: they are generated in the simgrid_files/ folder of each workflow.

   
   c. the simulator.



2) "laucher_generator_2.sh": generate the scripts used to launch simulation with different parametres.
 
   run_simulations_workflow-XXXX.sh will be generated for each workflow by "all_launcher_generator.sh" 
 

3) "all_execute_prestaging.sh": launch the simulation scenarios by selecting the replication algorithm


   "all_execute_prestaging.sh dyn" means that running the simulation by using the dynamic replication algorithm implemented in our simulator. 
   	
   Simulation results will be stored in workflow-XXX/csv_files/ with the following format:

   simulated_file_transfer_on_"platform"_"prestaginglist"_"replication_algo"_1.csv
